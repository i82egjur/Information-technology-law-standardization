## Reading the ISO/IEC 7498-1 (also known as ITU-T X.200):

### 1.  Standard document structure:
#### a) List the sections of this standard
1. Foreword
2. Contents
3. Summary
4. Scope
5. Definitions
6. Notation
7. Introduction to Oen Systems Interconnection
8. Concepts of a layered architecture
9. Introduction to the specific OSI layers
10. Detailed description of the resulting OSI architecture
11. Management aspects of OSI
12. Compliance and Consistency with this reference model
13. Annex A, Brief explanation of how the layers were chosen
14. Annex B, Alphabetical index to definitions

#### b) Which of these sections so you expect to find in all standarsds?

1. Foreword
2. Contents
3. Summary
4. Scope
5. Definitions
6. Notation
7. I coul find some Annex too, although it has not have to be this specific ones


#### c) Do the specific sections follow any concrete order? Which order?



### 2. What kind of information is included in the foreword?

- In the foreword, it makes a brief introduction of the organization that create the standard. 
  It makes the approval of Recommendations  by  the  Members  of  ITU-T. Finally, in the foreword is mentioned the 
  collaboration basis with ISO and IEC.
  
  
 ### 3.  What organizations have participated in the development of this standard?
 
 - The ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector ***(ITU-T)*** which is a permanent organ of the Internation Telecomunication Union ***(ITU)***. As the International Telecommunication Union, (1994) said this organizations cooperates with some 179 member countries, 84 telecom operation entities, 145 scientific and industrial organizations and 38 international organizations participate in ITU-T which is the body which sets world telecommunications standards.

- They have collaborate with ISO and IEC too, and the Worl Telecommunication Standardization Conference has take part too approving the Recommendations.


### 4. What information is given in the summary (named “introduction” in ISO printed version)?

- It makes a global introduction about the text, it introduced the organization involved in the development of the text. The areas identified and the purpose
of the text. 


### 5. What information is given in the scope section?

- Through the 19 items, the scope describe certaiun words, talking about their purpose, which make its open. Some issues about The 
Reference Model. The stages of the develop of the Basic Reference Model of OSI. Additional aspects of this Reference Model beyond
the basic aspects described in several parts. And finally, some information about utilities of the Basic Referenc Model.


### 6. Why are all paragraphs numbered?

- According to (Khoury, 2019), the 3 main reasons for numbering the paragraphs are:

1. Easy for Judges and Clerks to Reference Citations
2. Easier to Work With Collaborators
3. Confirming Your Arguments by the Numbers

### 7. What is included in the “definitions” section of any standard?

- Vocabulary mentioned in the text which has not a clear meaning. This is defined in those sections.

### 8. What must be included in the notation section of a standard?
- Here it is described any letter or simbol used for refering any expression.

### 9. What is an open system according to this standard? What are the advantages of the interconnection model proposed?
- 






### 10. Section 5 describes the layer architecture. 
#### a) Which are the main principles used to design this structure? 


#### b) What are the services offered from one layer to another? 


#### c) What are the information units? 


#### d) What is the connection mode?


11. What does section 6 describes? What is the motivation for choosing the 7 layers of the OSI model?

12. What information is given in the section 7? 

13. What information is given in the section 8? 


14. What is explained in section 9? Should all standards have a section like this? Why is it important in this case?
