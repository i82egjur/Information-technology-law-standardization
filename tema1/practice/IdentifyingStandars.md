# IEEE 802.11 ax: High efficiency WLANs

## 1. Brief description of the standard.

- The standard 802.11 is a standard's family created by the Institue Electrical and Electronics Engennieers. Looking forward to an improvement of 
  spectrum efficiency to enhance the system throughput/area in high density scenarios of APs and/or STAs according to (IEEE P802.11 - TASK GROUP AX, 2019).
  
 -  Specifically, 802.11 ax, is join in this group with others such us 802.11b/g/n/ac. Aditionally,
    its representing a evoluti√≥n of the standard 802.11 ac, that later in the second part we are
    going to descrive more effusively.
  
- This is called as WIFI 6, its a type of WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) designed for working in 
  2.4GHz y 5 GHz.
