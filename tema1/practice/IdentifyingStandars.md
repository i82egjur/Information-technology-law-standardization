# IEEE 802.11 ax: High efficiency WLANs

## 1. Brief description of the standard.

- The standard 802.11 is a standard's family created by the Institue Electrical and Electronics Engennieers. Looking forward to an improvement of 
  spectrum efficiency to enhance the system throughput/area in high density scenarios of APs and/or STAs according to (IEEE P802.11 - TASK GROUP AX, 2019).
  
 -  Specifically, 802.11 ax, is join in this group with others such us 802.11b/g/n/ac. Aditionally,
    its representing a evolutión of the standard 802.11 ac, that later in the second part we are
    going to descrive more effusively.
  
  - This is called as WIFI 6, its a type of WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) designed for working                
     in 2.4GHz y 5 GHz.
     
## 2. Advantages

- In concrete, 802.11ax represent an evolution of the standard 802.11ac, that according to 
  cisco's website its apports efficiency, flexibility and escalability that permits that news and
  currents networks aument the speed and capacity with their news applications. (¿Qué
es 802.11ax? - Wi-Fi de próxima generación, 2020). Besides, its improve data nominal speed in a 
37%.

### Classification of the standard.
#### 1. According to its subject matter.
- Networks

#### 2. According to its origin
- The family of standars 802.11, are _"de jure"_ standars that through the years it has become 
  a _"de facto"_ standar, due to the fact thar it is the first implemented standard in the market
  that refers to this area. However, specially 802.11 ax, we would say that it is "de jure" because
  it has been created by the IEEE and there is no habit in using this specifically one.
  
#### 3. According to its open or closed character
- We would say its is open since is world wide free and there is no restriction in implementacion or discrimination between users.


#### 4. Scope of the standard (international, national, local, company...).
- According to the IEEE website it is the "the world largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humaninity".
  So we would say its an international standard.



#### 5. Legal implications (if we are forced to use the standard in some situation). Explain

- Actually there is no law that force the use of this standard, although it is right that there are
  certain scopes from networks, we could either choose it or not. Provided that we are in the legal
  framework.
