## Definition of an open standard

- Actually there is not any definition of what an open standard is, although, it is generally considered to be a standard created through a process
  where any interested party may freely participate and collaborate and made available to the general public on a royalty free and non-discriminatory basis.

- It has been argued that an open standard is more than a mere specification. An open standard is "open" because of the principles behind it and because of the way
  in which it has been developed, approved and made accessible.
  
- Generally, an open standard is build in the participle that it is available for every end-user to obtain, read and implement, with no royalty or fee _(tarifa)_, 
  Certain parties have argued that a fee may be imposed, ehich must the be a low or reasonable cost.
  
- An open standard is also based on the principle of non-discrimination, so that no software producer is favoured over another. 
- Copyright or patents which cover standards must be licensed royalty-free and withouth discriminatory terms.
