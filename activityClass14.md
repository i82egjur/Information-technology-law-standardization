Activity 14.2 - Video: Copying is not theft [1]
Before watching the video:
If not already done, answer question 3) of the video "Piracy is a crime".
What are the rights protected by the legislation on copyright (or author’s rights)?
• Moral rights
• Economic rights:
◦ Reprduction
◦ Dsitribution
◦ Public communication
◦ Transformation
◦ Compensatory

While watching the video (read the questions before):
1) What difference does the video highlight between two types of actions?
  - Stealing a thing leves one less left
  - Copying it makes one thing more
2) What copyright is violated when making copies?
 - Economic rights for reproduction, and depend of the use of the copy, distribution, public communication or compensatory.
3) What disadvantages and/or what advantages could society have for generalizing the nonprotection of these specific rights? (justified opinion: the opinion is not evaluated, it is assessed that
the justification is well founded)
 - Actually, if society cannot copy and distributing information without the explicit permission of the author, makes extremelly hard, the global distribution
 of this information. Apart from that, if we cannot transformate this goods, the improvement of this good, is extremelly limitated. Regardless of the anterior,
 if we are copying something, we are not letting the principal author to enjoy the results its invention has created, and from a more moral point of view, it 
 is not so good. 
- For the previously exposed reason, it is extremelly hard to determined, if generalizing the nonproctection of this rights are good or bad. There are
a huge amount of pros and cons for each approach. For that reason, although for the society nonprotecing the rights is good, for the specific author, is 
not as good. However, the author could be benefited in other jobs.
