5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, **under this License** to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.
This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.
**To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.** section 11
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.

A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. 
For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

## 4. 
Following the steps shown in the section **How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs**

## 5.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General 
Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered 
version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, 
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

Each GPL version is distinghished with a version number. If a program specifies a certain numbered version 

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions
