# Unit 2 Practice - Cloud computing standards.


Since the beginning of cloud computing, it has suffer a quick evolution process of consolidation, transformation and optimization. This process has made it reach its current point. Nowadays, the main trends in this topic are hyper automation in the Cloud, quantum computing, democratization of software development capabilities, containerization in Application Development and lots of things too.

Firstly, democratization of software development capabilities are a really important need to face due to the fact that cloud-base platforms and software systems will continue to make advanced technology  as Nikitin, (2020) said. It makes extremely important the fact of being able to develop application that can work in whatever context we want. Something that we tackle with standardization for instance.

Secondly, containerization in application development, has appeared in order of increase scalability, performance. It works encapsulating the software code and all of its dependencies into a package. Docker and kubernetes are some priceless examples of it that are extremely important nowadays.

In conclusion, cloud computing is a really interesting topic that is in a current process of innovation and evolution. For this reason, we have chosen democratization of software and containerization as one of the main worries and advances in the current context.
