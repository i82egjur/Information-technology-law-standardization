## CLASS ACTIVITY: ***"Cloud computing standards"***

## Read the text and:

###  Identify the standards mentioned

- Standard railroad gauges
- TCP/IP
- Open Virtualization Format (OVF)
- HD, DVD, Blu Ray.
- Open Grid Forum
- Computing Interface (OCCI)
- vCloud API
- Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF)
- libvirt
- Unified Cloud Interface Project
- cloudloop

### Identify advantages mentioned
- Standard railroad gauges enabled cross continental travel.
- TCP/IP unlocked worldwide communications

### Identify development process kinds
- First a need to meet appear
- Certain people develop a standard for covering that need and its become a "de jure" standard 
- Sometimes if it is a really problem solving standard it may become a "de facto" standard.
- Some examples of this is TCP/IP or some mentioned in the first section.

### Main ideas
- The text show us the situation that made standards so important, the process and the firsts main standarts that has appeared. Besides, it talks more 
  specifically about certain standarts essentialls for cloud computing, and a few major APIs. Also, the text mention virtuals machines and some standars  
  refering to it.
  
 ### What order does the text follow?
 1. An introduction talking about the need of standards
 2. First main standards and their advantages
 3. Start talking about cloud computing and virtual machines
 4. Others challenges solved by using APIs
 5. Describe APIs, PAAS and SAAS, advantages, standards and issues that the have.
