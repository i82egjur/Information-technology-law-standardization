# 1. Choose some software user documentation and answer the following questions considering IEEE1063 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 26514 standard (Maximum 300 words)

## 1. What user manual are you answering about? (name, version, url)
**- Name:** Skype Connectâ„¢ user guide  
**- Version:** 4.0  
**- URL:** https://download.skype.com/share/business/guides/skype-connect-user-guide.pdf 

## 2. What is the target audience?
- We can read in the section called _"About this guide"_, the following statements, _"This guide has been written for administrators of Skype Connect..."_ and
_"This guide may also be a useful reference for any Skype Channel Partner responsible for setting up Skype Connect for a customer with a SIP-enabled PBX"_ _(Skype ConnectTM User Guide, 2011)_. For that reason, we identify **_administrators_** and _**professional users**_ as the target audience. 

## 3. Which usage modes are supported?


## 4. Does it follow the standard? (What agrees? What does not? Explain with an example)
- Firstly, if we consider the standard IEEE 1063, we can focus on the components required by the standard. In that standard, we can appreciate in the _table 1_ an usefull list of the required components. Taking that into account, we can see the next: 
  - Identification data, we can apreciate documentation title, documentation version and date published, software version and issuing organization.
  - Table of contents _(page 6)_
  - Introduction in eache chapter and topic, we can appreciate introductory sections. 
  - Information for use of the documentation, we can see it for instance in the section 9.0 called "Architects - a summary" and in the section 10 "Important dos and don'ts. In those sections we can see recommendations on which members of the audience should consult wich sections of the summary.   
  - Concept of operations. 

# 2. Design an strategy for the development of user documentation for LibreOffice.org or a similar large software package. You must define the documents to be created, the structure of these documents with the description of the contents to be included (very briefly). There could be documents for printing or electronic access or help systems... The design must follow the standards seen in this unit. Use as example for the design the tables seen in the presentation.

- We would need documents for describing every software that offered libreOffice. We would cover libreoffice calc, writter, impress, math, draw and base.
- Firstly, we should choose wich standard to cover. We would consider IEEE 1063.  
- Secondly, every document must cover the following components. More or less the structure of the document for every aplication is the same.
  - Identification data (package label/title page)    
  - Table of contents (in documents of more than eight pages after the identification data)    
  - List of illustrations (Optional)  
  - Introduction   
    - An introduction that describe the intented audience, scope and purpose, and in each chapter introductions shall be provided.
  - Information for use of the documentation  
    
  - Concept of operations  
  - Procedures (instructional mode)  
  - Information on software commands  (reference mode)  
  - Error messages and problem resolution  
  - Glossary (if documentation contains unfamiliar terms)  
  - Related information sources (Optional)  
  - Navigational features  
  - Index (in documents of more than 40 pages)  
  - Search capability (in electronic documents)
