# 7 Standards for developing and documenting computing projects

# Author: Rafael Egea Jurado


# 1. Choose some software user documentation and answer the following questions considering IEEE1063 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 26514 standard (Maximum 300 words)

## 1. What user manual are you answering about? (name, version, url)
**- Name:** Skype Connect™ user guide  
**- Version:** 4.0  
**- URL:** https://download.skype.com/share/business/guides/skype-connect-user-guide.pdf 

## 2. What is the target audience?
- We can read in the section called _"About this guide"_, the following statements, _"This guide has been written for administrators of Skype Connect..."_ and
_"This guide may also be a useful reference for any Skype Channel Partner responsible for setting up Skype Connect for a customer with a SIP-enabled PBX"_ _(Skype ConnectTM User Guide, 2011)_. For that reason, we identify **_administrators_** and _**professional users**_ as the target audience. 

## 3. Which usage modes are supported?
- Mostly instructional, since the main concerned of the manual is to make a tutorial about certain topics.

## 4. Does it follow the standard? (What agrees? What does not? Explain with an example)
- Firstly, if we consider the standard IEEE 1063, we can focus on the components required by the standard. In that standard, we can appreciate in the _table 1_ an usefull list of the required components. Taking that into account, we can see that most of the requirement are covered, nevertheless there are some of them such as error messages and problem resolution that are not covered. For that reason, I said that it does not follow the standard.

# 2. Design an strategy for the development of user documentation for LibreOffice.org or a similar large software package. You must define the documents to be created, the structure of these documents with the description of the contents to be included (very briefly). There could be documents for printing or electronic access or help systems... The design must follow the standards seen in this unit. Use as example for the design the tables seen in the presentation.

- We would need documents for describing every software that offered libreOffice. We would cover libreoffice calc, writter, impress, math, draw and base.
- Firstly, we should choose wich standard to cover. We would consider IEEE 1063.  
- Secondly, every document must cover the following components. More or less the structure of the document for every aplication is the same.
  - Identification data (package label/title page)    
  - Table of contents (in documents of more than eight pages after the identification data)    
  - List of illustrations (Optional)  
  - Introduction   
    - An introduction that describe the intented audience, scope and purpose, and in each chapter introductions shall be provided.
  - Information use of the documentation  
    - Some sections could be included that respond to who is the manual for? or what is there? or What minimum requirements are there to use it? 
  - Concept of operations 
    - Conceptual background for using the software, explaining of the concept of operation that should be adapted to the expected familiarity of the users with the systems.
  - Procedures (instructional mode)
    - It should be necessary to include instructions to ease deling with several functions like the recomended ones by the standard IEEE 1063:
      - Software installation and de-installation
      - Orientation to use of the features of the graphical user interface 
      - Access, or log-on and sign-off the software— Navigation through the software to access and to exit from functions
      - Data operations (enter, save, read, print, update, and delete)
      - Methods of canceling, interrupting, and restarting operations
   
 
  - Information on software commands  (reference mode)  
  - Error messages and problem resolution  
   - How to solve certain errors. 
  - Glossary (if documentation contains unfamiliar terms)  
  - Related information sources (Optional)  
   - If desired it could be nice
  - Navigational features  
   - For searching specific items, it must be covered. 
  - Index (in documents of more than 40 pages)  
  - Search capability (in electronic documents) 
    
## Example of a writter user manual.
I will do the writter one in more detail, but the others would be very similar.

- In the first section 
 - Copyright, contributors, version, publishing date and some comments.
- Secondly
 - A brief introduction
 - what is that for?
 -  Where to find help?
 -  Common questions
-  Thirdly
 - What is writter
 - Menus, and dialogs.
- In fourth place
 - Basic concepts
 - Who to select text
 - Copy, paste text 
- In fifth place 
 - Some advanced features.  
- In sixth place
 -  printing, exporting to pdf, sending by mail 
-  An introduction to the styles and how to work with them, templates and images.
-  Tables of context.
-  Configuration and personalization.
