### About the Nvidia license text:

#### What type of license is it (sale, rental, use permit ...)?
There are several aspects that we have to take into account at the time of answer this question.
- This **License For Customer Use** of NVIDIA Software ("LICENSE") is the agreement which governs use of the software of NVIDIA 
Corporation and its subsidiaries (“NVIDIA”) downloadable herefrom, including computer software and associated printed materials ("SOFTWARE").
- The SOFTWARE is **not sold**, and instead is only **licensed for use**, strictly in accordance with this document. 
- This licens is an use permit licnese

#### As a customer, what rights are you granted over the software?
- The answer is in the section 2. GRANT OF LICENSE. The customer has the right to install and use a single copy of the software on a single computer
except for making one back-up copy of the software. The license may not be shared or used concurrently on different computers.

#### Is there any clause that could be considered abusive or not valid in the European Union?
- Maybe reverse engineering but, since it is said that "If any provision of this LICENSE is inconsistent with, or cannot be fully enforced under, 
the law, such provision will be construed as limited to the extent necessary to be consistent with and fully enforceable under the law". We can
say thats ther is not an abusive or invalid clause.

### About the text of the GNU GPL license:

#### What is the preamble for?
- For stablishing terms, so everything can be understood properly (_When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price..._).

#### Where is the well-known viral clause (that the modifications made on a GPL software must also be distributed with a GPL license)?
- In the section 7 c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or 
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version.

#### How is this license protected against software patents?
It said:
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11). If we go to the section 11, we can see that
there is a full section in order to specify the patents


#### How can you apply this license to your programs?
Following the instructions told in **How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs**

#### If you apply this license to your code, are you granting future GPL v4 to your licensees? Can you not grant them? Can GPL v4 be a non-free license? Why?

It says the following:  

14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not 
specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
