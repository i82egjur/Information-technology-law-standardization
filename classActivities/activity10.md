### 1 What sort of powers are identified in the video?
- Legislative, executive and judicial
### 2 Do they match with the powers identified in Montesquieu text?
- Yes, they do.

### 3 How is the power separation applied in EU? And in spain?
- Theorically in spain and EU, the power separation is the one identified in the 1 questions.

- My reflexion about that. It is commondly believe that in Spain exists this kind of separation, nevertheless it actually does not exists
or it does not exists at its best. A few months ago, Pedro Sanchez was trendy for its declaration that saids: "The governament legislates".
Anyways in the 1978 constitution it is hard to find a separation of origin. For instance in the article 68.3 it is said that "The election will be
verified in each constituency according to criteria of proportional representation." Wich implies the election of the executive and legislative in the same
elections. Something that is critized since its proposal by Sir Rowland Hill, a remarcable one was the analisis made by the director of "The economist" Walter
Bagehot. A clear example of this lack of separation is that by agreement or by absolute majority the head of a political party makes the laws, 
applies them and rules the judges. 

- In a nutshell, from my humble point of view, in Spain there is not a proper separation of powers.
